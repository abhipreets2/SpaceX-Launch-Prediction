# SpaceX-Launch-Prediction

## About Project

SpaceX provides space launches at a marginally lower rate than its other competitors, this is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage, therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land or not, we can determine the cost of the launch. Our end goal is to create a classification model to find if SpaceX will reuse its first stage or not, using the dataset which we aquire.

## Data collection
Data was collected by web scraping and using API, these datasets were later merged
